# Test application for AngularJS Explore Tools

This test application installs an NPM package `explore-components-angularjs` from a private registry @nirmalpatel21 and runs the 4 explore components in the index.html file.

The index.html file imports CreateJS and component files using `<script>` tags.

Please change the package `explore-components-angularjs` definition in package.json as needed (change the NPM registry and the version number).
